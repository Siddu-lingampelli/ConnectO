**Fallback:** If browser doesn't support voice, the microphone button is hidden and users can still use text input normally.

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. **Select Language** - Choose your preferred language from the dropdown
2. **Click Microphone** 🎤 - The button inside the search box
3. **Speak** - Clearly say your search query
4. **Auto-Search** - Search executes automatically when speech ends
5. **Alternative** - You can always type manually instead

### For Developers:
```tsx
import VoiceSearch from './components/search/VoiceSearch';

<VoiceSearch
  value={searchQuery}
  onSearch={(text) => {
    setSearchQuery(text);
    handleSearch();
  }}
  placeholder="Search..."
/>
```

## Security & Privacy

- ✅ Requires microphone permission from browser
- ✅ Audio is processed locally in browser
- ✅ No audio data sent to external servers
- ✅ User can deny microphone access (fallback to text input)
- ✅ Recording stops automatically after speech ends

## Performance

- 🚀 Lightweight - No external API calls
- 🚀 Fast response - Real-time speech-to-text
- 🚀 No latency - Browser-native processing
- 🚀 No cost - Completely free (no API keys needed)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
