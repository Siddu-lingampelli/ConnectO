## 🔗 Navigation Flow Map

### **Public Routes** (MainLayout)
```
/ (HOME)
├── /how-it-works
├── /categories
├── /about
├── /contact
└── Header links to:
    ├── /auth/login
    └── /auth/register
```

### **Auth Routes** (AuthLayout)
```
/auth/login
├── Success → Redirects based on role:
│   ├── Admin → /admin/dashboard
│   ├── Provider → /provider/dashboard
│   └── Client → /client/dashboard
└── Link to → /auth/register

/auth/register
├── Success → Redirects based on selected role:
│   ├── Provider → /provider/dashboard
│   └── Client → /client/dashboard
└── Link to → /auth/login
```

### **Client Routes** (DashboardLayout + ProtectedRoute + RoleBasedRoute)
```
/client/dashboard (ClientDashboard)
├── /client/post-job
├── /client/jobs (My Jobs)
├── /client/browse-providers
├── /client/wallet

## 🛡️ Protection & Middleware

### **ProtectedRoute**
- Checks: `isAuthenticated` from Redux
- Redirects to: `/auth/login` if not authenticated
- Saves location in state for redirect after login

### **RoleBasedRoute**
- Checks: `user.role` matches `allowedRoles[]`
- First checks: Authentication (redirects to `/auth/login`)
- Then checks: Role permission (redirects to `/401`)

### **AuthLayout Auto-Redirect**
- If user is already authenticated → Redirects to `/` (HOME)
- Prevents logged-in users from accessing login/register pages

---

## 🔙 Back Button Implementation

### **BackButton Component** (`src/components/common/BackButton.tsx`)
- Uses: `navigate(-1)` to go back to previous page
- Shows: ← Back

### **Locations:**
1. **MainLayout**: Shows on all pages except HOME
2. **AuthLayout**: Top-left corner on login/register pages
3. **DashboardLayout**: Top bar next to page title

---

## 🚪 Logout Functionality

### **Dashboard Logout Button**
- Location: Top-right corner of DashboardLayout
- Action: 
  1. `dispatch(logout())` - Clears Redux state
  2. Clears localStorage (user, token, refreshToken)
  3. `navigate(ROUTES.AUTH.LOGIN)` - Redirects to login

### **Header Logout (for public pages)**
- Location: User dropdown menu in Header
- Action:
  1. `dispatch(logout())` - Clears state
  2. `navigate(ROUTES.HOME)` - Redirects to home page

---

## 📝 Form Submissions

### **RegisterForm**
```typescript
On Submit:
1. Validates: fullName, email, phone, city, area, password, confirmPassword, agreeToTerms
2. Creates user with role: 'client' or 'provider'
3. Auto-login: Calls userStorage.login()
4. Updates Redux: dispatch(setCredentials())
5. Shows success toast
6. Navigates to:
   - Provider → /provider/dashboard
   - Client → /client/dashboard
7. Fallback: window.location.href if navigate fails
```

### **LoginForm**
```typescript
On Submit:
1. Validates: email, password
2. Calls: userStorage.login()
3. Updates Redux: dispatch(setCredentials())
4. Navigates based on role:
   - admin → /admin/dashboard
   - provider → /provider/dashboard
   - client → /client/dashboard
```
