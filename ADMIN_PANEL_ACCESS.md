# Admin Panel Access Guide

This document explains the admin panel access feature added to the ConnectO platform.

## Overview

An admin panel button has been added to the homepage that provides quick access to the admin dashboard. This btton is **only visible to users with admin role**.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Admin Panel Button on Homepage

**Location**: Top right corner of the homepage header

**Visibility**: Only visible when a user with `role === 'admin'` is logged in

**Design**:
- Red-to-pink gradient button (⚙️ settings icon)
- Text: "Admin Panel"
- Hover effects with shadow elevation
- Positioned before Login/Get Started buttons

**Navigation**: Clicking the button navigates to `/admin` (Admin Dashboard)

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx`

### Changes Made:

1. **Import Updates**:
   - Added `selectCurrentUser` selector from authSlice
   - Now checks both authentication status and user role

2. **Conditional Rendering**:
   ```tsx
   {currentUser?.role === 'admin' && (
     <button onClick={() => navigate('/admin')}>
       Admin Panel
     </button>
   )}
   ```

3. **Navigation Logic Update**:
   - Modified the auto-redirect logic to exclude admin users
   - Admin users can stay on homepage to access admin panel
   - Regular users (client/provider) are redirected to dashboard as before

## Admin Routes Available

The admin panel provides access to:

1. **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`)
   - Overview of platform statistics
   - Quick access to users and verifications

2. **User Management** (`/admin/users`)
   - View all clients and service providers
   - Manage user accounts
   - View user details and activity

3. **Verification Management** (`/admin/verifications`)
   - Review pending verifications
   - Approve or reject verification requests
   - View verification documents

## How to Access Admin Panel

### For Admin Users:

1. **From Homepage** (Not Logged In):
   - Visit homepage
   - Click "Login"
   - Login with admin credentials
   - After login, you'll see the "Admin Panel" button
   - Click to access admin dashboard

2. **From Dashboard** (Already Logged In):
   - If logged in as admin, you can also navigate directly to `/admin`
   - Or logout and visit homepage to see the admin button

### For Regular Users:
- The admin panel button is **NOT visible**
- Only admin role can see and access this feature
- Clients and providers will see normal Login/Get Started buttons only

## Security Features

1. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Button only renders for users with `role === 'admin'`
   - Frontend route protection via ProtectedRoute middleware
   - Backend API endpoints require admin authorization

2. **Conditional Redirect**:
   - Admin users are NOT auto-redirected to dashboard from homepage
   - Allows admins to access the homepage and admin panel button
   - Regular users still get redirected to dashboard as normal

3. **Visual Distinction**:
   - Admin button uses distinctive red-pink gradient
   - Different from blue client/provider buttons
   - Settings gear icon makes it recognizable as admin function

## User Roles

The platform supports three user roles:

1. **Client** (`role: 'client'`)
   - Can post jobs
   - Can hire service providers
   - Can view and manage orders

2. **Provider** (`role: 'provider'`)
   - Can browse and apply to jobs
   - Can submit proposals
   - Can complete work and receive payments

3. **Admin** (`role: 'admin'`)
   - Can access admin panel
   - Can manage users (clients and providers)
   - Can review and approve verifications
   - Full platform oversight

## Creating Admin Users

To create an admin user, you need to:

1. **Via Database**:
   - Directly update a user's role in MongoDB
   - Set `role: 'admin'` for the user document

2. **Via Backend API** (if admin creation endpoint exists):
   - Use admin creation endpoint
   - Requires super admin or initial setup access
