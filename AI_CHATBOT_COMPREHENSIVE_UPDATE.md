**Possible Statuses:**
- ⏳ **Pending**: Admin hasn't assigned demo task yet (wait 24-48 hours)
- 📝 **Under Review**: You submitted demo, admin is reviewing
- ❌ **Rejected**: Demo score was below 60% (you can request another attempt)
- ✅ **Verified**: You're approved! (Jobs should be accessible)

**2. If Verified but Still Can't Apply:**
- Make sure you're looking at jobs matching your provider type
- Technical providers can ONLY apply to Technical jobs
- Non-Technical providers can ONLY apply to Non-Technical jobs

**Need Help?**
Check your notifications for demo task assignments or contact support from Settings → Help Center.
