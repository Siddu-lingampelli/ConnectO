## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Provider can apply for jobs without demo:
- Check if demo verification check is in ApplyJob.tsx
- Verify user object has demoVerification field

### Demo not showing in dashboard:
- Check if DemoStatusCard is imported in Dashboard.tsx
- Verify API endpoint /api/demo/my-demo works

### Admin can't assign demo:
- Check if user exists with provided email
- Verify user role is 'provider'
- Check backend logs for errors

### Score doesn't auto-verify/reject:
- Check demo.controller.js reviewDemo function
- Verify score comparison: score >= 60 ? 'Verified' : 'Rejected'

### Activity log not updating:
- Check if activityLog.push() is called in controller
- Verify demo.save() is called after adding log

---

## üìù Notes

- Demo status in User model and DemoProject must stay in sync
- Admin can manually override status using "Update Status" (if implemented)
- Freelancers can only see their own demo
- Admin sees all demos across all freelancers
- Pagination defaults to 10 demos per page
- Statistics auto-refresh on data changes

1. Browser console for frontend errors
